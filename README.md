ALTERNATIVE PLAYLIST GENERATION IDEAS

1. The user could complete a quiz which would ask them questions about their taste in music. Because of how broad music is,
   they will have to answer an initial question on which genre they like the most, this would consist of a condensed list of
   the 10 most popular genres: Rock, Jazz, Electronic Dance Music, Dubstep, Techno, R&B, Country, Pop, Indie Rock, and Electro.
   From here, depending on the genre they picked there will be a series of follow up questions to narrow their taste further.

2. Another method can be to sort music by ‘mood’. This means that songs will have to be categorised by their vibe, emotions,
   and energy. This includes categories like happy, sad, chill, dance, workout, background, sleep etc. The user will choose the
   mood that they want their playlist to embody. The algorithm will then work to select songs to match that mood.
